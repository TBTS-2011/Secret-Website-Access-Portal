# Project Overview

This program presents itself as a standard website, but upon entering the correct key, it will redirect the user to a different webpage containing the requested information. However, entering the incorrect key will result in the website redirecting the user to a different webpage that appears to reference a dummy virus, simulating the installation of a virus onto the computer. For privacy reasons, an actual virus download link has not been included.

## Steps to Access the Website

1) Download the Malware.exe file to your desktop.
2) Run the server.py file.
3) Copy and paste the URL provided by the server.py file into any browser.
4) Upon the website launch, upload the Malware.exe file.
5) After uploading the file, the website will redirect you to a different website containing confidential information. You can customize the file to include information on any subject.
6) Failing to execute the steps outlined in point 4 properly will result in the website redirecting you to another webpage containing a fake virus. This fake virus, harmless in nature, is engineered to incite fear in those who inaccurately enter the required key, and will automatically download to the desktop.

## Preview

<strong>Note:</strong> Upon copying and pasting the URL provided by the server.py file into any browser, a website identical to the preview below will commence running. Only on that website, you will be able to add the provided Malware.exe file to access another covert website. The content of this secret website will intentionally be left blank, enabling you to customize it for your specific needs.
