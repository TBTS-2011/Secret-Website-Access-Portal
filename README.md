# Project Overview

This program presents itself as a standard website, but upon entering the correct key, it will redirect the user to a different webpage containing the requested information. However, entering the incorrect key will result in the website redirecting the user to a different webpage that appears to reference a dummy virus, simulating the installation of a virus onto the computer. For privacy reasons, an actual virus download link has not been included.

## Steps to Access the Website

1) Download the key.exe file to your desktop.
2) Run the index.html file and nothing else. Upon the website launch, upload the key.exe file.
3) After uploading the file, the website will redirect you to a different website containing confidential information. You can customize the file to include information on any subject.
4) Failing to execute the steps outlined in point 4 properly will result in the website redirecting you to another webpage containing a file which is supposed to simulate installing a virus. This file, harmless in nature, is engineered to incite fear in those who inaccurately enter the required key, and will automatically download to the downloads folder.
