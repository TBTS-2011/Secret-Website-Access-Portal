# About this project:

This program seems to be a regular website at first glance, but when the correct key is entered, it will redirect the user to a different webpage with the requested information. However, if the wrong key is entered, the website will redirect the user to another webpage that appears to link to a dummy virus, simulating the installation of a virus onto the computer. For privacy reasons, I have not included an actual virus download link.

## Steps to access this website:

1) Download the Malware.exe file onto your desktop.
2) Run the server.py file.
3) Copy and Paste the URL provided by the server.py file to any browser.
4) When the website launches, upload the Malware.exe file.
5) After uploading the file, the website will redirect you to a different website that contains some confidential information (you can customise the file to add information about anything).
6) If the procedure listed in step 4 is not executed properly, then the website will redirect you to a different webpage that contains a virus (dummy virus that causes no harm but inflicts fear onto those people who incorrectly enter the required key), which will automatically download onto your desktop (which is supposed to wreak havoc).

## Patches:

| Versions | Supported          |

| 1.0.0    | :white_check_mark: |

## Preview:

<strong>Note:</strong> When the URL provided by the server.py file is copied and pasted onto (any) browser, a website that looks identical to the below preview will start running. Only on that website, you will be able to add the provided Malware.exe file to get access to another secret website (that will be left black for anyone else to customise and use as they want).

### The main website in disguise as a coffee website:
